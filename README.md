# FAQ:

### What is Streamlink Portable?
A program to build a portable version of Streamlink for Windows.

### What are the supported platforms?
Windows 7 SP1 or later with .NET Framework 4.x (4.7 recommended).

### What can I do with it?
Build between three flavors:
* Portable EXE (Recommended): For users who prefer to have all available files in the same folder.
* Standalone EXE: For users who prefer to have all files packed within the executable.
* Portable BAT: Same as Portable EXE but a batch file is generated instead of an executable.

By default the building source is the <a href="https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/commits/master">latest available commit</a> (nightly) or the <a href="https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/releases/latest">latest stable</a>.
<br>
No system files are modified and you can run it from anywhere (such as flash drive or other external drives).

### Can I download a ready-to-use release without using the program?
Yes, you can find precompiled releases <a href="https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-portable/releases">here</a>.
<br>
Note that only stable releases are available, for nightly builds you have to use the program.
