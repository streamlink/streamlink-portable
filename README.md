A program to build a portable version of Streamlink for Windows.

### What are the supported platforms?
Windows Vista SP2 or later with .NET Framework 4.5+.

### What can I do with it?
Build between three flavors:
* Portable EXE (Recommended): For users who prefer to have all available files in the same folder.
* Standalone EXE: For users who prefer to have all files packed within the executable.

No system files are modified and you can run it from anywhere (such as flash drive or other external drives).
